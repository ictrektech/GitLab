    # redis-client middleware that proactively re-issues AUTH on a live
    # connection shortly before a rotating access token (for example a
    # Microsoft Entra token) expires, so pooled connections are refreshed
    # before the server rejects a command. Connect-time authentication is
    # handled by the callable password (TokenCredential); this only covers
    # already-established, long-lived connections.
    #
    # The provider caches a single token process-wide and advances its
    # `expires_at` whenever any connection triggers a refresh. Each pooled
    # connection, however, stays authenticated with whatever token it last sent
    # AUTH with. We therefore track expiry per connection (redis-client builds
    # one middleware instance per connection) rather than reading the shared
    # provider expiry, so a connection still holding the old token re-auths
    # instead of being skipped because another connection already refreshed.
    #
    # Registered globally via RedisClient.register, so it runs for every
    # connection but is a no-op unless a credentials provider descriptor is
    # present in the connection's `custom` config.
