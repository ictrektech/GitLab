        SHORT_PLAN = <<~MARKDOWN
          ## Why

          Users want to export their data.

          ## How

          Add an export button.
        MARKDOWN

        FULL_PLAN = <<~MARKDOWN
          ## Why

          Project maintainers cannot see which pipelines are slow without opening each one.
          A per-project summary lets them spot regressions in a single view.

          ## How

          1. Add a `PipelineDurationSummary` finder that aggregates durations by week.
          1. Expose it through a new `project.pipelineDurationSummary` GraphQL field.
          1. Render a bar chart on the CI/CD analytics page behind the `pipeline_duration_summary` flag.

          ## What

          - [ ] Finder with specs for empty, single, and multi-week ranges
          - [ ] GraphQL field with N+1 spec
          - [ ] Vue chart component with Jest specs and empty state
          - [ ] Documentation update in `doc/ci/pipelines/pipeline_efficiency.md`

          ## Acceptance criteria

          - Durations match the pipeline list for the same range.
          - The chart loads in under one second for projects with 10,000 pipelines.
        MARKDOWN

        PARTIAL_PLAN = <<~MARKDOWN
          ## Why

          Project maintainers cannot see which pipelines are slow.

          ## How

          Aggregate pipeline durations and show them on the analytics page.

          ## What

          - [ ] Backend aggregation
          - [ ] Frontend chart
