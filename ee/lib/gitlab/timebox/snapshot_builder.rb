    # SnapshotBuilder can build snapshots (`Gitlab::Timebox::Snapshot`s) of issues and tasks for a timebox.
    # As of March 2024, SnapshotBuilder was designed to work with issues and tasks, not generally with work items.
    #
    # The `issues` table only captures the latest state of an issue/task.
    # SnapshotBuilder can reconstruct the ending states of issues and tasks
    #  assigned to a timebox using resource events records (e.g., ResourceStateEvent), one snapshot per
    #  date that has a change.
    #
    # Example. Given some timebox, say Milestone A (starts on date N and ends on date N + 2),
    # SnapshotBuilder can reconstruct the end states of the issues/tasks assigned to the timebox on each date.
    #
    #   Snapshot on Date N:
    #     Issue 1 was open (open => open) and assigned to Milestone A.
    #
    #   Snapshot on Date N+1:
    #     Issue 1 got closed (open => closed) and still assigned to Milestone A.
    #       Task 1 was added to Issue 1
    #
    #   Snapshot on Date N+2:
    #     Issue 1 got reopened (closed => reopened).
    #       Task 1 was removed from Issue 1
    #     Issue 2 was added to Milestone A
