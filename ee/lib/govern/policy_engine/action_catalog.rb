    # Which executor handles an authored action, and whether it needs enforce
    # mode. Which actions a trigger accepts is the policy store's save-time
    # check (GOVERN-016), so a decision's actions are legal for its trigger
    # by construction and dispatch makes no second ruling.
    #
    # An observing action runs in every mode, because an audit-mode policy
    # exists to produce its trail. Only the state-changing actions carry
    # enforce_only; the first of those, set_setting, arrives with its
    # executor in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/630155.
    #
    # block has an entry without an executor. The fence consumes its
    # decisions at the save point, so it dispatches nowhere, but the engine
    # knows it: a block decision is not an unhandled action.
